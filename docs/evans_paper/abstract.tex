We introduce a DPG method for convection-dominated diffusion problems.  The choice of test norm is shown to be crucial to achieving robust behavior with respect to the diffusion parameter \cite{DPGrobustness}.  We propose a new inflow boundary condition which regularizes the adjoint problem, allowing the use of a stronger test norm.  The robustness of the method is proven, and numerical experiments demonstrate the method's robust behavior.
